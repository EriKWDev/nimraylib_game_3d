# About
Having fun with [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/examples.html) ([nimraylib_now bindings for nim](https://github.com/greenfork/nimraylib_now)). I have never felt so empowered to do computer graphics as with nim + raylib. It's really fun!

I also use my own editor "plugin" for nimraylib_now [nimraygui_editor](https://github.com/EriKWDev/nimraygui_editor) to edit variables and manage debug windows.
